# Build Scalable Data Pipeline Infrastructure

## Feature Description
Implement a robust, parallelized data pipeline infrastructure that supports bulk backfills, incremental updates, and lookback corrections. This foundational framework will be used by all data ingestion pipelines and executed via GitHub Actions, following a TDD approach with proper monitoring and error recovery.

## User Story
As a **data engineer**, I want **a scalable pipeline infrastructure that handles different job types and processing patterns** so that **we can efficiently ingest, process, and maintain fresh data while handling corrections and backfills reliably**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Pipeline Framework
- [ ] Create base pipeline class with common functionality (logging, error handling, retries)
- [ ] Implement parallel processing using Python multiprocessing/asyncio
- [ ] Support configurable worker pools for bulk operations
- [ ] Create job parameter system for flexible execution modes
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- [ ] Add dead letter queue for failed records

### Job Execution Modes
- [ ] **Bulk Backfill Mode**: Process historical data with parallel workers
  - [ ] Partition data by season/date ranges
  - [ ] Progress tracking and resumability
  - [ ] Configurable batch sizes
- [ ] **Incremental Mode**: Process only new/changed data
  - [ ] Track last successful run timestamps
  - [ ] Delta detection logic
  - [ ] Minimize API calls for unchanged data
- [ ] **Lookback Mode**: Reprocess recent data for corrections
  - [ ] Configurable lookback window (e.g., 7 days)
  - [ ] Merge strategy for corrections
  - [ ] Audit trail for data changes

### Data Processing Pattern
- [ ] **Stage 1: Extract** - Fetch raw data from APIs
  - [ ] Rate limiting with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Request deduplication
  - [ ] Response caching for retries
- [ ] **Stage 2: Load Raw** - Store complete API responses
  - [ ] JSONB storage in raw_* tables
  - [ ] Versioning for schema changes
  - [ ] Compression for historical data
- [ ] **Stage 3: Transform** - Process into normalized tables
  - [ ] Schema validation
  - [ ] Data quality checks
  - [ ] Foreign key integrity
- [ ] **Stage 4: Post-Process** - Update derived tables
  - [ ] Aggregations and metrics
  - [ ] Cache warming
  - [ ] Notification triggers

### GitHub Actions Integration
- [ ] Create reusable workflow templates
- [ ] Support both scheduled and manual triggers
- [ ] Parameter passing for job modes
- [ ] Secrets management for API credentials
- [ ] Job status notifications (success/failure)
- [ ] Artifact storage for logs and reports

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Metrics collection (records processed, API calls, duration)
- [ ] Data quality metrics (null rates, outliers)
- [ ] Pipeline health dashboard
- [ ] Alert thresholds for failures
- [ ] Performance profiling for optimization

### Testing Strategy (TDD)
- [ ] Unit tests for each pipeline component
- [ ] Integration tests with mocked API responses
- [ ] Data validation test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Failure scenario testing
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline tests

### Database Design
- [ ] Create `pipeline_runs` table for job tracking
- [ ] Create `pipeline_checkpoints` for resumability
- [ ] Create `data_quality_checks` for validation results
- [ ] Implement partitioning strategy for large tables
- [ ] Add appropriate indexes for query patterns
- [ ] Design archival strategy for old raw data

## Technical Considerations
- **Parallelization**: Use asyncio for I/O-bound tasks, multiprocessing for CPU-bound
- **Batch Sizes**: Dynamic sizing based on API rate limits and memory
- **Idempotency**: All operations must be safely re-runnable
- **Transaction Management**: Atomic commits per batch
- **Memory Management**: Stream processing for large datasets
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Data Versioning**: Track schema versions for backward compatibility

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core framework with basic job modes
2. **Phase 2**: Parallel processing and optimization
3. **Phase 3**: GitHub Actions integration
4. **Phase 4**: Monitoring and alerting
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features (CDC, streaming)

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL with JSONB support
- GitHub Actions runner configuration
- Python 3.11+ with asyncio support

## Priority
**Critical** - This infrastructure is required before implementing any data ingestion pipelines

## Labels
- `feature`
- `infrastructure`
- `data-pipeline`
- `backend`
- `critical`

## Additional Notes
- Future: Consider Apache Airflow or Prefect for future orchestration needs
- Future: Design with cloud migration in mind (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions)
- Future: Consider data lineage tracking for data quality audits
- Future: Real-time streaming with webhooks
